#Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Implementation and Classification

This repository hosts the implementation of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in the model.py file. ELM is a single-layer feedforward neural network that combines the power of neural networks with efficient training techniques. The model.py file contains the code for constructing and training an ELM model, making it an ideal starting point for exploring this machine learning algorithm.

Repository Contents:

model.py: A Python script containing the implementation of the Extreme Learning Machine.
Example dataset: Includes a dataset for a classification problem to demonstrate the ELM's performance.
Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment to understand the algorithm step by step.
